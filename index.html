    <li><strong>PoV – Proof of Value Protocol</strong></li>
    <li><strong> Introduction</strong><br>
      AURUM (AUR) starts as a meme coin but follows a serious, long-term vision: a deflationary token system backed by real Zcash. The foundation is formed by publicly visible ZEC reserves that remain permanently in the system. AURUM combines the charm of a community token with true value coverage.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong> Proof of Value (PoV)</strong><br>
1. Introduction
AURUM (AUR) is a community-driven meme token designed to combine simplicity, transparency, and fair distribution. Built around the principles of shared growth, AURUM rewards its holders in Zcash (ZEC) and maintains a visible reserve to support long-term stability.

2. Mission
AURUM aims to create a strong and united community that builds value together. The token focuses on transparency, fair rewards, and a sustainable reward ecosystem backed by ZEC.

3. Token Overview
Token Name: AURUM
Ticker: AUR
Total Supply: 21,000,000,000 AUR
Type: Community Meme Token 4. Token Distribution
50% Reserve
50% Rewards to Token Holders
The distribution ensures stability through the reserve while directly rewarding active community participation.

5. Fee & Reward System
Every transaction applies a 8% tax, collected in Zcash (ZEC).
Allocation of the 8% ZEC Tax:
50% → Reserve
50% → Distributed to all token holders every 24 hours
Rewards are proportional to each holder’s share of the total supply.

6. Reserve System
The reserve acts as the backbone of AURUM, helping maintain stability and future development potential.
The reserve is fully visible on the official website.
A portion of the reserve will be used in the future as staking rewards, once the project reaches a stable and established growth phase.

7. Community Vision
AURUM is built for the community and by the community.
The project’s strength comes from its holders, who contribute, support, and grow the ecosystem together.
No central control, no complex structures—just a transparent meme token with real utility and continuous rewards.
      
8. Roadmap
Phase 1 – Launch
Token deployment
Reserve setup & website transparency
Reward distribution system live
Phase 2 – Growth
Marketing, community building, partnerships
Expanding the meme culture and engagement
Phase 3 – Expansion
Staking rewards introduced
Additional utilities & integrations
Strengthening reserve mechanisms
      
9. Conclusion
AURUM combines simplicity, transparency, and community power. 
With automatic ZEC rewards, a visible reserve, and a strong growth vision, AURUM is designed to evolve into a self-sustaining ecosystem shaped by its holders. <br>

AURUM is not a financial product. It is a community-driven utility token.
Not a security, not an investment – no promises of profit or price.
the reserve only serves as transparent value coverage – not a guarantee or redemption claim.
AURUM is decentralized, open source, and not owned or controlled by any entity.
Started as a meme coin – but built for real value.</p>

    <h2><img src="favicon-64-transparent.png" class="minief7a4c27427dbDFE4F7597c-icon" />Vision</h2>
    <div class="toggle-content">
      <p>AURUM becomes independent.</p>
  <p>Bitcoin paved the way as the first and strongest digital asset, but Zcash represents what Bitcoin was originally meant to be: sound money with true privacy.
Because Zcash is still early and not yet dominated by large financial actors, it holds massive long-term potential.

AURUM builds its reserve in Zcash to benefit directly from this future growth.
As ZEC adoption increases and the technology matures, the AURUM reserve and all holders will be positioned to profit from the rising value and expanding ecosystem.

AURUM is not just a meme token — it is a community project that believes in the future of Zcash and grows alongside it.</p>

    <div class="toggle-content">
      <p><ul>
      <li><strong>Is AURUM a financial product?</strong> No. AURUM is a fun, community-driven meme token.
        It’s not a security, investment, or regulated financial product. Holding AURUM is for entertainment and community participation only.</li>
      <li><strong>What about the Zec reserve?</strong> The Zcash reserve is a playful concept – a demonstration of “value backing” for the meme.
        It is shown on explorers, but it is purely symbolic and does not guarantee profits or redemption.</li>
      <li><strong>Can I redeem AUR for ZEC?</strong> No real ZEC is paid out. Any references to redemptionare part of the protocol’s storytelling and meme concept.
        This is not a financial service.</li>
        i><strong>Risks:</strong> AURUM is experimental and high-risk. It’s a meme coin, so its price can go up, down, or vanish entirely.
        Users participate for fun and the community experience.</li>
