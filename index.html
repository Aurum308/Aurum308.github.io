      <p><ol>
    <li><strong>PoV – Proof of Value Protocol</strong></li>
    <li><strong> Introduction</strong><br>
      AURUM (AUR) starts as a meme coin but follows a serious, long-term vision: a deflationary token system backed by real Bitcoin. The foundation is formed by publicly visible BTC reserves that remain permanently in the system. AURUM combines the charm of a community token with true value coverage.
    </li>
    <li><strong> No Central Company – 100% Decentralization</strong><br>
    <li><strong> AURUMBTC (aBTC)</strong><br>
      Unlike centralized solutions like WBTC, which can be frozen or censored, AURUM's own wrapped Bitcoin (aBTC) will only exist on the AURUM blockchain: censorship-resistant, fully decentralized, secured by BTC in a 3/5 multisig wallet.<br>
      The protocol defines the swap mechanism: Anyone exchanging AUR for aBTC.<br>
      This process is irreversible – it reduces AU supply and aBTC pool simultaneously, adding a deflationary effect.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Bitcoin Reserve & Irreversibility</strong><br>
      Once BTC enters the AURUM reserve, it permanently exits market circulation. No withdrawals, no reclaiming. The reserve remains in the system forever – creating a reliable, transparent, and immutable value base for AU.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Halving & Migration</strong><br>
      20 million AUR (Halving-Coins) are sold on Solana in exchange for Sol or BTC. Proceeds are converted into WBTC and added to liquidity pools. These coins represent future "mining" rewards.<br>
      On the AURUM blockchain, coins will only be distributed through staking to node operators – daily, with halving cycles like Bitcoin.<br>
      Node operators secure the network and receive:
      <ul>
        <li>Halving-coins as reward</li>
        <li>Transaction fees</li>
      </ul>
      This provides long-term decentralized network security – based on staking, not mining.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Conclusion</strong><br>
      AURUM is more than a meme – it’s a deflationary BTC value system.<br>
      A place where Bitcoin stays – transparent, decentralized, final.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Why Bitcoin Must Stay in AURUM</strong><br>
      BTC is becoming scarcer – institutions accumulate while retail access becomes harder. AURUM reacts by collecting real BTC and locking it permanently in the system.<br>
      These BTC are non-sellable, non-withdrawable, and secured in a multisig wallet.<br>
      Anyone holding AUR indirectly participates in this protected reserve.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Proof of Value (PoV)</strong><br>
      AURUM follows PoV – a new principle: value coverage instead of trust.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Each AUR is backed by real BTC</li>
        <li>Halving-Coins only exist via WBTC swaps</li>
        <li>On-chain, Halving-Coins are distributed to nodes (no energy waste)</li>
      </ul>
      PoV maintains balance:
      <ul>
        <li> BTC swaps stay in reserve</li>
        <li>Burning of AUR reduces supply</li>
        <li>Voluntary BTC donations grow reserve</li>
      </ul>
      AUR only exists when value has been contributed – by BTC or network security.
    </li>
    <li><strong> Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
      AURUM is not a financial product. It is a community-driven utility token.<br>
      Not a security, not an investment – no promises of profit or price.<br>
      the reserve only serves as transparent value coverage – not a guarantee or redemption claim.<br>
      AURUM is decentralized, open source, and not owned or controlled by any entity.<br>
      Started as a meme coin – but built for real value.
    </li>

    <h2><img src="favicon-64-transparent.png" class="minief7a4c27427dbDFE4F7597c-icon" />Blockchain Vision</h2>
    <div class="toggle-content">
      <p>In Phase two, AURUM becomes independent.</p>
  <p>The dedicated blockchain launches – lightweight, accessible, and entirely built on real Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>No centralized platform, no interim solution – but a decentralized network sustaining itself.</p>
  <p>The AURUM blockchain is intentionally designed to be accessible:</p>
  <p>Anyone who holds AUR can participate in the network with basic hardware.</p>
  <p>These nodes are lightweight, energy-efficient – and secure the decentralized system.</p>
  <p>This is AURUM’s core:</p>
  <p>We recall Bitcoin’s early days – when anyone could join with minimal resources.</p>
  <p>In AURUM, node operators take that role:</p>
  <p>They keep the network stable, validate transactions, and act like Bitcoin’s miners.</p>
  <p>For their contribution, they receive automated rewards:</p>
  <p>Regularly issued mining coins, halving every 4 years like Bitcoin, plus a share of transaction fees.</p>
  <p>Anyone holding AUR can participate – no special hardware, no complexity – open and accessible to all.</p>
  <p>AURUM is open source. Anyone can view, understand, and improve the code.</p>
  <p>The community participates. New applications, interfaces, and expansions are welcome.</p>
  <p>No admin access. No central function. The code is the law.</p>
  <p>And the BTC reserve?</p>
  <p>It remains the anchor. It grows over time – public, visible, permanent.</p>
  <p>Every AUR is backed by real BTC. While the reserve is fixed, the market price remains free.</p>
  <p>That means: There is always a real value floor – but no limit above.</p>
  <p>The market can value AUR higher – but never below the reserve’s value.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Those wishing to exchange AUR back into BTC can do so –</p>
  <p>but only via AURUM’s own wrapped Bitcoin (aBTC) with a 21% deduction.</p>
  <p>aBTC is AURUM’s internal form of Bitcoin, fully backed and circulating within the system.</p>
  <p>This protects the reserve and enables redemption – without destroying the foundation.</p>
  <p>Redeemed AUR is burned – permanently. This reduces supply and protects the system.</p>
  <p>This deduction isn’t a barrier but a safeguard – preventing abuse by large actors.</p>
  <p>Greed becomes unattractive. The reserve stays intact. The community remains stable.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🟡 AURUM – The Vision: Secure Bitcoin before it’s too late</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin is becoming scarce. Major exchanges, funds, and institutions are buying all they can.</p>
  <p>Access to BTC is growing more difficult and expensive for everyday users.</p>
  <p>AURUM responds by collecting real BTC – while it's still accessible – and locking it into the system forever.</p>
  <p>These BTC are not for sale. No one can retrieve them. They remain secured inside AURUM permanently.</p>
  <p>aBTC is the only internal access – fully backed and used only within the system.</p>
  <p>And that’s what gives AU its value.</p>
  <p>Because AUR isn’t just a token. AUR is a share of a system that permanently holds real BTC – publicly, securely, and censorship-resistant.</p>
  <p>Whoever understands this now stands where Bitcoiners stood in 2009: right at the beginning.</p>
  <p>The more BTC flows into the reserve, the higher the minimum value rises.</p>
  <p>And the market price? That remains free. But the floor stays – and it grows.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>AURUM is a digital vault. Open to all. Untouchable by others.</p>
  <p>What’s being created here is more than a project. It’s a new foundation –</p>
  <p>a new way to store value – not through computation, but through participation, trust, and transparency.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🟡 AURUM is secured by Bitcoin.</h3>
  <p>🔓 It has a floor – but no top.</p>
